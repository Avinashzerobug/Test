3) Generalization involves multiple entities and combine them into generalized entity and it creates number of entity sets and it creates high level entity with help of common features
Specialization involves single entities  broken down into multiple sub-entities and it is reverse of generalization

b)by using the declaration of class as a final.it can't be inherited by other class

c)Using the interface we can alternate multiple inheritance and using the extends keyword we can access the alternative properties from parent class

4)String class will be final in javaAPI because to make it immutable 

5) sorted collection are compareTo method.

6)ArrayList uses dynamic array to store the elements      LinkedList uses Doubly LinkedList store the elements
  ArrayList implements only List                           LinkedList implements List and Queue

7)ListIterator traverses in both forward and backward position
  Iterator traverse only forward position

11) by making the properties as a private ..using(private)keyword ..the properties can't access by the other classes only by setter,getter 
    and consturctor throug we can access the properties...so Hema  will achieve the security
